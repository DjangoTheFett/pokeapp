# pokeapp(name pending) an adventure in a website.

## The Plan

Currently as I write this you are simply able to type in a pokemon name and fetch a name a picture and stats, but I plan to make this so much more than that.

Pokeapp as im calling it for now is planned to be a text based adventure with some turn based battle mechanics built in. fight your way through a few areas battling trainers along the way. With nothing but your pokemon by your side can you make it to the end?
