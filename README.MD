# pokeQuest a search & battle adventure

 pokeQuest lets a user access the pokeAPI via a graphical user interface on the web.  
 The web app displays the stats of these pokemon dynamically. 
 This project is evolving into a text based adventure as I continue.


## current features
- Search for any pokemon by name
- Fetch live data from pokeAPI
- updating the DOM dynamically
- displays a sprite ,  name, base stats
- error handling for invalid inputs

## tech Used
- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- Async/await
- REST APIs
- HTML/CSS

## planned features
- text based battle adventure
- pokemon comparison page
- improved ui
- save progress for battle adventure via local storage

## What I Learned .. so far
- Making API requests with fetch
- Using async/await with real data
- Updating the DOM dynamically
- Structuring front-end code into reusable functions
- Handling user input errors
- Planning multi-page features



## why I built this

I am an early computer science student extremely interested in software development of all kinds. I am currently learning web development, this project came up as something I thought would help me learn alot including workign with REST API's and fetch and give me a chance to work with state as well as dynamically rendering data on a web page.
